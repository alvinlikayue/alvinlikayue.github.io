# About Me

My research and personal life have always been deeply connected. I have found immense solace and inspiration in the anime *Given*. Just as Mafuyu finds meaning through music, I navigate my world through **physics and discovery**.

ðŸŽµ *Given*'s music serves as a bridge between my personal emotions and my research. I often listen to tracks like **"Fuyu no Hanashi"** and **"Umi e"** while working on my gravitational wave research.

This section shares my personal journeyâ€”how my passion for science and music intersect.
